grepple
=======

Similar to grep/awk/ag, search a set of files for a term. Purely a learning experience.

# To do
* More tests for main file parsing routine
* More tests for main file opening routine, check for binary files
* Implement CLI argument parser
* Implement regular expression support
* Perform benchmarking. If performance is sub par, introduce pthreads?

# Installation
Coming soon!
